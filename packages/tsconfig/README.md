# tsconfig

Check out our [docs on GitHub].

A collection of different base `tsconfig.json` to be extended from in your project.

This project aims to reduce per-project configuration as much as possible. With good defaults, we can focus on building, not configuration!

## Installation

Using npm or yarn:

```sh
yarn add --dev @spotify/tsconfig
```
